These classes were migrated out of InSpec, specifically [inspec/lib/objects](https://github.com/inspec/inspec/tree/master/lib/inspec/objects).

InSpec does not uses these classes directly. They can be used to programmatically create InSpec profiles.

No further documentation or support is available.
